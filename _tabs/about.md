Hi! 

I'm *Krixtalx*, Jos√© Antonio, a computer engineer(BSc) focused on computer graphics who is currently finishing his master studies(MSc). I have, pretty much, started my career and, while I'm not exactly a beginner in this field, don't expect very advance post. In fact, don't expect any post at all, as I don't really know how much I will continue this blog. 

The main focus of this blog is having to write down and explain, in detail, the progress (and the failures) made in my own personal projects. The reason behind it is having to [put ideas into words](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html), revealing things that I could think that I trully understand but not. The principal motivation of making it public isn't something like getting known by other people, but having to make sure the things I write could be read by anyone. 

I'm trully inspired by others people blog, such as [Bits, Pixels, cycles and more](https://zeux.io/) or [Nick's Blog](https://nickmcd.me/), and a huge follower of very greats graphics engineers like [Sebastian Aaltonen](https://twitter.com/SebAaltonen) or [Kostas Anagnostou](https://twitter.com/KostasAAA).

Without anymore to say, I hope that enjoy this blog!
